# Van Vleck Recursion: Mathematical Background

This document provides a detailed mathematical explanation of the Van Vleck canonical transformation as implemented in VanVleckRecursion.jl, based on the theoretical framework from Venkatraman et al. (2022).

## Physical Problem

### Driven Quantum Systems
Consider a quantum system with time-dependent Hamiltonian:
```
H(t) = H₀ + H₁cos(ωt) + H₂cos(2ωt) + ...
```

Where:
- `H₀`: Static (time-independent) Hamiltonian
- `H₁cos(ωt)`: Primary oscillating drive at frequency ω
- Higher harmonics can also be included

### The Secular Problem
Traditional time-dependent perturbation theory often produces terms that grow linearly in time (secular terms):
```
|ψ(t)⟩ ≈ |ψ₀⟩ + εt|ψ₁⟩ + ε²t²|ψ₂⟩ + ...
```

These secular terms invalidate the perturbative expansion for long times t >> 1/ε, making traditional approaches unsuitable for understanding long-time dynamics.

### Van Vleck Solution
The Van Vleck method eliminates secular terms by finding a canonical transformation to a time-independent effective Hamiltonian:
```
H_eff = e^S H(t) e^(-S) - iℏ e^S (∂e^(-S)/∂t)
```

Where `S = S₁ + S₂ + ...` is constructed order by order to eliminate time dependence.

## Mathematical Framework

### Canonical Transformation
The Van Vleck transformation uses a near-identity canonical transformation generated by `S`:
- **Classical**: `{F, S}` (Poisson bracket with generating function S)
- **Quantum**: `[F, S]/iℏ` (commutator with generator S)

### Rotating Wave Approximation
The method systematically separates terms by their time dependence:
- **Static terms** (rotating=0): Time-independent, contribute to effective Hamiltonian
- **Oscillating terms** (rotating=1): Time-dependent, average to zero or generate corrections

### Frequency Ordering
In the high-frequency limit ω → ∞, terms are ordered by powers of 1/ω:
```
H_eff = H₀ + (1/ω)H⁽¹⁾ + (1/ω²)H⁽²⁾ + ...
```

## Recursive Formulas

### Kamiltonian K(n,k)
The effective Hamiltonian is built from Kamiltonian contributions:
```
H_eff = Σₙ Σₖ K(n,k)
```

Where:
- `n`: Perturbative order (power of coupling strength)
- `k`: Frequency order (power of 1/ω)

**Base Case:**
```
K(0,0) = H₀  (unperturbed Hamiltonian)
```

**Recursive Relations:**
```
K(0,1) = Ṡ(1)                                    (time derivative of first generator)
K(n,1) = Ṡ(n+1) + {S(n), K(0,0)}                (for n ≠ 0)
K(n,k) = (1/k) Σₘ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ {S(n-m), K(m,k-1)}      (for 1 < k ≤ n+1)
K(n,k) = 0                                       (for k > n+1)
```

### Generator S(n)
Generators eliminate oscillating terms through canonical transformations:

**Construction:**
```
S(n) = ∫ rot([oscillating parts of expression]) dt
```

**Recursive Formula:**
```
S(0) = 0                                         (no zeroth-order transformation)
S(1) = ∫ rot([-K(0,0)]) dt                      (eliminate static H₀ oscillations)
S(n) = ∫ rot([-{S(n-1), K(0,0)} - Σₖ₌₂ⁿ K(n-1,k)]) dt  (for n > 1)
```

## Key Operations

### Bracket Operation: {A, B}
Represents Poisson brackets (classical) or commutators (quantum):
- **Classical**: `{A, B} = ∂A/∂q ∂B/∂p - ∂A/∂p ∂B/∂q`
- **Quantum**: `[A, B] = AB - BA` (in units where ℏ=1)

**Rotation Rules:**
- `{static, oscillating} → oscillating`
- `{static, static} → static`
- `{oscillating, oscillating} → static + oscillating`

### Time Derivative: Ṡ
Time derivatives of generators appear in Kamiltonian formulas:
- `∂/∂t [static] = 0`
- `∂/∂t [A cos(ωt)] = -ωA sin(ωt) ~ -iωA e^(iωt)`

### Rotation Operation: rot(·)
Extracts oscillating components for integration:
- `rot(static) = 0`
- `rot(oscillating) = oscillating`

### Time Integration: ∫ dt
Integrates oscillating terms to build generators:
- `∫ A cos(ωt) dt = (A/ω) sin(ωt)`
- Static terms cannot be integrated (would create secular terms)

## Physical Interpretation

### Order by Order Analysis

**Zeroth Order (n=0):**
- `K(0,0) = H₀`: Original static Hamiltonian
- `K(0,1) = Ṡ(1)`: First frequency correction

**First Order (n=1):**
- `S(1)`: Eliminates first-order oscillations from H₁cos(ωt)
- `K(1,1) = Ṡ(2) + {S(1), H₀}`: Second-order effective terms

**Higher Orders:**
Each order systematically eliminates oscillations and generates effective static terms at appropriate frequency orders.

### Frequency Expansion
The effective Hamiltonian has the structure:
```
H_eff = H₀ + (ε/ω)H⁽¹⁾ + (ε²/ω)H⁽²⁾ + (ε²/ω²)H⁽³⁾ + ...
```

Where ε is the drive strength and ω is the drive frequency.

## Implementation Features

### Exact Arithmetic
The Julia implementation uses `Rational{Int64}` for exact calculations, avoiding floating-point errors that can accumulate in high-order perturbation theory.

### Caching Strategy
Both generators and Kamiltonians are cached using global dictionaries:
- `KAMILTONIAN_CACHE::Dict{Tuple{Int,Int},Terms}`
- `GENERATOR_CACHE::Dict{Int,Terms}`

This prevents expensive recomputation of overlapping subproblems in the recursive structure.

### Term Representation
Each term tracks:
- Rotation character (static vs oscillating)
- Numerical factor (with exact rational arithmetic)
- Frequency dependence (powers of 1/ω)
- Operational history (bracket structure)

## Applications
